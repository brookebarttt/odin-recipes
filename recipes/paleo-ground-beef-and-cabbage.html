    <h2 class="title">Paleo Ground Beef and Cabbage</h2>
    <p>This classic dish is simple, but packs a <strong>powerful</strong>
      punch of taste! You may be accustomed to eating ground beef and 
      cabbage, but did you know that it is also a perfect choice if you 
      are on a paleo diet? With just a few ingredients, you can eat like
      your paleolithic ancestors...without all the running from wild 
      animals!  
    </p>

    <p><em>Note: </em>Do not drain the meat after cooking. This will diminish the flavor! For this recipe,
      90/10 ground beef is recommended.</p>
