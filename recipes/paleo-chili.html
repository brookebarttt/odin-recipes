    <h2 class="title">Paleo Chili</h2>
    <p>While <strong>pinto beans</strong> are generally considered to be a staple of any chili recipe, 
        that is not the case with recipes that adhere to the paleo diet.  Designed to most closely resemble
        the diet of our paleolithic ancestors, paleo chili is made without the beans and any thickening
        flour derived from grains.  Not to fear, this recipe delivers all of the flavor and none of the 
        unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms often associated with chili.  Everyone around you says thank 
        you! </p>

    <p><em>**Note:</em> While this dish can be immediately eaten after preparing, it is best enjoyed
        after allowing the flavors to meld and intensify for roughly 24 hours.  Non-paleo folks can add   
        pinto beans.  Beef can also be substituted for bison and turkey sausage for pork sausage.</p>
