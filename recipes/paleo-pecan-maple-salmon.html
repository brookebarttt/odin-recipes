    <h2>Paleo Pecan-Maple Salmon</h2>
    <p>This incredible dish sounds <strong>fancy</strong>, but is actually quite simple.
    It's also a great go-to for those on the paleo diet.  It's both hearty and sweet,
    while also keeping things healthy. It's sure to satisfy those cravings!</p>

    <p><em>Note: </em>Be careful not to overcook the salmon! Once it flakes easily (as 
    described in <strong>Step 4)</strong>, it's time to remove it from the oven.</p>

        <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets salmon</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chipotle pepper powder</li>

    </ul>

        and season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 <em>(5 mins)</em>:</strong> Combine pecans, vinegar, maple syrup,
        paprika, onion powder, and chipotle powder in a food processor and pulse until texture

        <li><strong>Step 3 <em>(2-3 hours)</em>:</strong> Refrigerate coated salmon, uncovered.</li>
